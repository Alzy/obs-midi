# OBS-MIDI
Use MIDI devices to trigger events in OBS and visa versa.

OBS MIDI came about because two guys complained about the same thing, within the same hour, and decided to try to take on the task

Those two guys are
* [Alzy](https://github.com/Alzy) and
* [Chris](http://github.com/cpyarger)

# Installing Extra Steps - Ubuntu SNAP
- If you install OBS Studio via snap you will need to run the following command to give permissions for OBS to access the raw MIDI devices through ALSA

sudo snap connect obs-studio:alsa
```
