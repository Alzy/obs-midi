You\textquotesingle{}ll need \href{https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.15/}{\texttt{ Qt 5.\+15.\+2}}, \href{https://cmake.org/download/}{\texttt{ CMake}} and a working \href{https://obsproject.com/wiki/install-instructions}{\texttt{ OBS Studio development environment}} installed on your computer.

Once you have successfully built OBS Studio, in the obs-\/studio source directory


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Go into the \{obs-\/studio\}/plugins
\item {\ttfamily git clone -\/-\/recursive git@github.\+com\+:cpyarger/obs-\/midi.\+git}
\item open \{obs-\/studio\}/source/\+CMake\+Lists.txt
\item append {\ttfamily add\+\_\+subdirectory(obs-\/midi)} to the end of the file
\item rerun cmake-\/gui configure, generate
\item in cmake-\/gui you will need to set a few variables
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item (path){\ttfamily LIBOBS\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+DIR = \{obs-\/studio\}/libobs}
\item (filepath){\ttfamily LIBOBS\+\_\+\+LIB = \{obs-\/studio-\/build\}/libobs/\+Debug/obs.lib}
\item (path){\ttfamily QTDIR = C\+:\textbackslash{}Qt\textbackslash{}5.\+15.\+2\textbackslash{}msvc2019\+\_\+64}
\item (boolean){\ttfamily is\+CI = true}
\item (filepath){\ttfamily OBS\+\_\+\+FRONTEND\+\_\+\+LIB = \{obs-\/studio-\/build\}/\+UI/obs-\/frontend-\/api/\+Debug/obs-\/frontend-\/api.lib}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

in cmake-\/gui configure, generate, and open project

Now you should be good to edit things\hypertarget{md_build_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Linux}\label{md_build_autotoc_md2}
On Debian/\+Ubuntu \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get install libboost-\/all-\/dev}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone -\/-\/recursive git@github.com:cpyarger/obs-\/midi.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd obs-\/midi}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build \&\& cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/DLIBOBS\_INCLUDE\_DIR="{}<path to the libobs sub-\/folder in obs-\/studio's source code>"{} -\/DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=/usr -\/DUSE\_UBUNTU\_FIX=true ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{make -\/j4}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo make install}

\end{DoxyCode}


On other linux OS\textquotesingle{}s, use this cmake command instead\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/DLIBOBS\_INCLUDE\_DIR="{}<path to the libobs sub-\/folder in obs-\/studio's source code>"{} -\/DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=/usr ..}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_build_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{OS X}\label{md_build_autotoc_md3}
As a prerequisite, you will need Xcode for your current OSX version, the Xcode command line tools, and \href{https://brew.sh/}{\texttt{ Homebrew}}. Homebrew\textquotesingle{}s setup will guide you in getting your system set up, you should be good to go once Homebrew is successfully up and running.

Use of the mac\+OS CI scripts is recommended. Please note that these scripts install new software and can change several settings on your system. An existing obs-\/studio development environment is not required, as {\ttfamily install-\/build-\/obs-\/macos.\+sh} will install it for you. If you already have a working obs-\/studio development environment and have built obs-\/studio, you can skip that script.

Of course, you\textquotesingle{}re encouraged to dig through the contents of these scripts to look for issues or specificities.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone -\/-\/recursive git@github.com:cpyarger/obs-\/midi.git}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd obs-\/midi}
\DoxyCodeLine{./CI/install-\/dependencies-\/macos.sh}
\DoxyCodeLine{./CI/install-\/build-\/obs-\/macos.sh}
\DoxyCodeLine{./CI/build-\/macos.sh}
\DoxyCodeLine{./CI/package-\/macos.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}


This will result in a ready-\/to-\/use {\ttfamily obs-\/midi.\+pkg} installer in the {\ttfamily release} subfolder.\hypertarget{md_build_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Automated Builds}\label{md_build_autotoc_md4}
